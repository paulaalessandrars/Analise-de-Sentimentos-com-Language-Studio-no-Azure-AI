Customer Review:
I had a fantastic experience at Sabor & Tradi√ß√£o! The ambiance was warm and welcoming, making it an ideal spot for a relaxing meal. From the moment I walked in, the staff greeted me with a smile, and their attention to detail was evident throughout. I ordered the feijoada, which was simply outstanding ‚Äî rich in flavor, perfectly cooked, and served piping hot. The service was impeccable; the staff was attentive but not overbearing, ensuring I had everything I needed. The billing process was swift and accurate, which added to the overall positive experience. The only slight downside was the wait time during peak hours, but it was well worth it. I will definitely return and highly recommend Sabor & Tradi√ß√£o for anyone looking for a delicious, authentic meal with top-notch service!
